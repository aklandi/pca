# Principal Component Analysis

In this repository, I write code for the dimension reduction technique called Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for the use in application of image compression and text classification.

- In pca.R, there is a full implementation of pca in R.   
- In python_pca.py, skeleton code is provided in python3.  Skeleton code has partial code and lots of comments so that you might fill it in yourself!  Give it a try.  You could use the pca.R as inspiration, but the two languages use different functions.
- In virginica.jpg, you will find a color image of an iris, species virginica.
- In virginica_compressed.jpg, you'll find the result from pca.R

Enjoy.  Feedback is welcome.
